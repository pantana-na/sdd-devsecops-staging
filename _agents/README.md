## The Three Consolidated Governance Rules (Hybrid Trigger Architecture)

All agent and developer workflows comply with three consolidated rule files in [`_agents/rules/`](./rules/):

1. **3-Phase AI-SDLC, Spec-Driven Development (SDD) & 4-Step RCA (`trigger: always_on`):** Orchestrated by the [`ai-sdlc` skill](./skills/ai_sdlc/SKILL.md) across **Phase 1: Inception**, **Phase 2: Execution (SDD)**, and **Phase 3: Operation**. Enforces `ask_question` clarification on any unknowns, interactive phase gates, brownfield baselines (`specs/baseline/`), feature specs (`specs/features/`), Unit + Property-Based Tests (PBT) at every step, continuous progress tracking (`specs/plan/`), and the **Mandatory 4-Step RCA Protocol** on failing tests/evals (zero quick patches, mockups, or regex workarounds) ([`_agents/rules/spec_driven_development.md`](./rules/spec_driven_development.md)).
2. **Google ADK & Agent Platform Runtime (`trigger: model_decision`):** Conversational AI agents and reasoning engines built with official Google ADK (`google-adk`) and deployed exclusively to the Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform (`agent_runtime`) via `agents-cli deploy`. Strictly cognitive model-driven reasoning and structured FunctionTools; zero hardcoded keywords or regex routing. Live evaluation via `agents-cli eval` ($\ge 95\%$ tool selection precision, 1.000 groundedness) ([`_agents/rules/google_adk_and_agent_runtime.md`](./rules/google_adk_and_agent_runtime.md)).
3. **DevOps, Security & Cloud Run Services (`trigger: model_decision`):** Single GitHub repository with multi-branch promotion. Pre-build SAST with CodeMender. Cloud Build CI/CD, Cloud Run hosting for web frontends and streaming API proxies with `/healthz` liveness probes, unified single-file `.env` parameter management, Infrastructure Manager Terraform IaC, and Domain Restricted Sharing (zero `allUsers`) ([`_agents/rules/devops_security_and_quality_standards.md`](./rules/devops_security_and_quality_standards.md)).

## Runtime Separation Architecture

| Workload Dimension | Conversational AI Agents & Reasoning Engine | Web Frontend, API Gateway & Streaming Proxies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target Runtime** | **Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform (`agent_runtime`)** | **Google Cloud Run (`cloud_run`)** |
| **Artifacts** | ADK Root Coordinator, Subagents, Model Armor hooks, `FunctionTool` registries. | React/Vite UI, Express/FastAPI proxy, WebSocket/SSE endpoints. |
| **Deployment** | `agents-cli deploy --deployment-target agent_runtime` | Cloud Build (`cloudbuild.yaml`) + Terraform via Infrastructure Manager |
| **Governance Rule** | [`_agents/rules/google_adk_and_agent_runtime.md`](./rules/google_adk_and_agent_runtime.md) | [`_agents/rules/devops_security_and_quality_standards.md`](./rules/devops_security_and_quality_standards.md) |
