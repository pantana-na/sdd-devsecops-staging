# Rule: 3-Phase AI-SDLC, Spec-Driven Development (SDD) & Root Cause Investigation Standard

## Core Mandate
All software engineering, architectural design, feature development, refactoring, testing, bug fixing, and cloud/agent deployments in this repository **MUST strictly follow the 3-Phase AI-Driven Software Development Lifecycle (AI-SDLC)** orchestrated by the **[`ai-sdlc` skill](../skills/ai_sdlc/SKILL.md)**:

1. **Phase 1: Inception (Intent Framing & Architecture)**
2. **Phase 2: Execution (The Spec-Driven Development Cycle)**
3. **Phase 3: Operation (Repository Integration, Security Gates & Dual-Runtime Deployment)**

Whenever a user initiates or continues a project, feature, architectural change, bug fix, or deployment, the agent **MUST immediately load and follow [`_agents/skills/ai_sdlc/SKILL.md`](../skills/ai_sdlc/SKILL.md)**, and load the relevant domain rules:
- **Conversational AI Agents (`agent_runtime`):** [`_agents/rules/google_adk_and_agent_runtime.md`](./google_adk_and_agent_runtime.md)
- **Cloud Run, CI/CD, SAST & IaC (`cloud_run`):** [`_agents/rules/devops_security_and_quality_standards.md`](./devops_security_and_quality_standards.md)

---

## 1. Mandatory Zero-Assumption Clarification & Phase Gate Protocol

Across **every phase** of the AI-SDLC (Inception, Execution, and Operation):

1. **Zero Silent Assumptions (`ask_question` Mandate):**
   - The agent **MUST NEVER** guess, invent, or silently assume unknown business requirements, target personas, brownfield behaviors, data model fields, API error contracts, IAM/Ingress patterns, workload sizing parameters, or target deployment environments.
   - Whenever any factor is ambiguous, underspecified, or missing, the agent **MUST pause and use the `ask_question` tool** (presenting clear choices with `(Recommended)` options and trade-offs) before proceeding.
2. **Strict Interactive Phase Gates:**
   - The agent **MUST NOT** automatically transition from **Phase 1 (Inception) $\rightarrow$ Phase 2 (Execution)**, from **Phase 2 Spec Authoring $\rightarrow$ Phase 2 Code Implementation**, or from **Phase 2 (Execution) $\rightarrow$ Phase 3 (Operation)** without presenting the completed phase artifacts and obtaining **explicit user sign-off via `ask_question`**.

## 2. Spec-Driven Development (SDD) & Brownfield Protocol (Phase 2)

**Code is a downstream artifact derived from specification documents.** No feature implementation, architectural change, refactoring, or API modification may begin without an approved Specification Document under `specs/`.

### 2.1 Brownfield Development Protocol (Mandatory Baseline First)
When working on an existing (brownfield) codebase or modifying any existing subsystem:
1. **Check for Baseline SDD:** Verify if an accurate Baseline SDD exists in `specs/baseline/` for the targeted component.
2. **Reverse-Engineer Baseline First:** If missing or outdated, inspect existing code, schemas, and APIs to generate a complete Baseline SDD under `specs/baseline/` (`system-overview.md` or `<subsystem>-baseline.md`) documenting the "as-is" architecture, data models, API contracts, business logic, external integrations, and core system invariants.
3. **Clarify Baseline Unknowns:** If any existing behavior is ambiguous or appears defective during discovery, pause and ask the user via `ask_question` whether to codify it as a baseline invariant or remediate it in the feature spec.
4. **Baseline Before Delta:** Only after `specs/baseline/` is established may feature specs (`specs/features/`) be drafted against it.

### 2.2 SDD Authoring & Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
1. **Feature Specification (`specs/features/SPEC-<YYYYMMDD>-<TITLE>.md`):**
   - Author using [`specs/templates/sdd-template.md`](../../specs/templates/sdd-template.md) covering: (1) Problem Statement & Goals/Non-Goals, (2) Dual-Runtime Architecture & Sequence Diagram, (3) Data Models & Type Contracts, (4) API & `FunctionTool` Contracts, (5) UI/UX State Machines, (6) Governance Checklist, (7) Step-by-Step Implementation Plan & Test Design, and (8) Plan Progress Tracking.
2. **Mandatory Testing Standards for EVERY Implementation Step:**
   - **Deterministic Unit Tests:** Concrete examples testing happy paths, boundary conditions, malformed payloads, and error handling.
   - **Generative Property-Based Tests (PBT):** Mathematical and logical invariants verified across randomized/fuzzed input spaces using `fast-check` (TypeScript/JS) or `hypothesis` (Python) (e.g., serialization round-tripping, canonical intent enum membership, security callback interception, state reducer invariants).
   - **Live Environment Agent Evaluation (`agents-cli eval`):** For ADK agent steps, evaluate against live backends verifying $\ge 95\%$ tool selection precision and $1.000$ ($100\%$) groundedness (see [`google_adk_and_agent_runtime.md`](./google_adk_and_agent_runtime.md)).
3. **Pre-Code Stakeholder Alignment Sub-Gate:**
   - Review the authored SDD and step-by-step test plan with the user and obtain explicit approval via `ask_question` before writing production code.

### 2.3 Living Specs & Plan Progress Tracking (`specs/plan/`)
1. **Zero Spec Drift:** Whenever code contracts, schemas, or behaviors change, update the corresponding SDD in `specs/` in the same change.
2. **Living Plan Progress Reports (`specs/plan/PROGRESS_REPORT_<YYYYMMDD>.md`):**
   - Continuously record linked SDD IDs, step-by-step completion matrices, unit/PBT/live-eval pass metrics, architectural decisions, RCA logs, and next actions.
   - Always update `specs/plan/` and synchronize `specs/README.md` before pausing development or transitioning between phases.

## 3. Mandatory 4-Step Root Cause Investigation (RCA) & Zero Quick-Patch Standard

When **any** test fails (**Agent Evaluation (`agents-cli eval`)**, **Property-Based Tests (PBT)**, **Unit Tests**, or **Integration/Smoke Tests**), or when a user reports a defect or requests a bug fix:

**DEVELOPERS AND AI AGENTS ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED FROM APPLYING QUICK FIXES, MOCKUP FALLBACK DATA, REGEX PATCHES, OR RULE-BASED CODE WORKAROUNDS.**

### 3.1 Strictly Prohibited Anti-Patterns (The "Quick-Fix" Trap)
1. ❌ **Mockup Data & Fallback Dictionaries:** Injecting synthetic fallback dictionaries or offline mockup data into application code to bypass missing/inconsistent database records (e.g., `if not db_result: return {"id": "ITEM-123"}`).
2. ❌ **Rule-Based Quick Patching & Special-Casing:** Writing prompt-specific `if/else` checks or hardcoding special-case answers for specific test inputs.
3. ❌ **Regex & Keyword Heuristics in Agents:** Adding regex matching or substring heuristics to patch agent intent classification or routing errors.
4. ❌ **Assertion Weakening / Test Deletion:** Modifying test assertions, deleting failing test cases, or widening tolerances simply to make a red test turn green.
5. ❌ **Hardcoding Domain Constants in Code:** Storing business rules, operational limits, or entity definitions in code constants instead of querying the live systems of record.

### 3.2 Mandatory 4-Step RCA Protocol
Execute these four steps sequentially whenever a failure or defect occurs:
1. **Step 1: Deep Root Cause Analysis (RCA):**
   - Inspect live database records, ADK `FunctionTool` docstrings, model system prompts, temperature settings, network logs, and stack traces to isolate the true data, cognitive, or architectural root cause.
2. **Step 2: Transparent Failure Explanation to User:**
   - Present a factual diagnostic report detailing the exact failing test/prompt, expected vs. actual output, technical root cause mechanics, and supporting log/query evidence.
3. **Step 3: Present Architectural Fix Options & Trade-Offs:**
   - Formulate at least **two (2) viable, sustainable architectural options** (e.g., Data Tier Resolution, Cognitive Tool Prompt/Docstring Refinement, or Schema/Contract Hardening) with pros, cons, blast radius, and effort.
4. **Step 4: Await Explicit User Instruction (`ask_question`) Before Coding:**
   - Present the options via `ask_question` and wait for the user's explicit selection before writing any code modification.

---

## 4. Artifact Directory Separation (`specs/` vs. `docs/`)

- **`specs/` (SDD Artifacts):** Baseline models (`specs/baseline/`), feature specifications (`specs/features/`), reusable templates (`specs/templates/sdd-template.md`), and living progress reports (`specs/plan/`).
- **`docs/` (Skill-Generated Operational Reports):** Visual architecture diagrams (`docs/*-architecture.md` & `.html`), CodeMender SAST reports (`docs/codemender-*.md`), and live GCP cost estimates (`docs/gcp_cost_estimate_*.md`).
