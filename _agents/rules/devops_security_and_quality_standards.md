# Rule: DevOps, Quality, Security & Cloud Architecture Standards

## Core Mandate
In addition to Spec-Driven Development (SDD), all software engineering, repository management, CI/CD pipeline automation, and cloud deployments must strictly adhere to the following 10 fundamental rules:

---

## Rule 1: Repository Management & Multi-Branch Environment Strategy
1. **Mandatory Single SCM Repository:** All source code, specifications, tests, configuration templates, and pipeline definitions must be version-controlled in a single **GitHub** repository.
2. **Branch-Based Multi-Environment Separation:**
   - The application manages **Non-Production (Non-Prod / Dev)** and **Production (Prod)** environments within the same repository using dedicated Git branches:
     - **Non-Prod Branch (`main` / `develop`):** Houses active development, feature integration, and continuous deployment to the Non-Prod environment.
     - **Prod Branch (`prod` / `release`):** Dedicated to stable, customer-facing production releases. Code is promoted to `prod` strictly via reviewed Pull Requests from the Non-Prod branch.
   - Commits must follow conventional commit standards with clear, descriptive scopes.
3. **Environment Promotion & Quality Gate:** No code may be merged to the `prod` branch without passing static code quality analysis, SAST, unit & property tests, and non-prod post-deployment verification.
4. **No Unversioned Artifacts:** No deployment or release shall occur from uncommitted or untracked local changes.

---

## Rule 2: Post-Commit Static Code Quality Analysis
1. **Automated Quality Inspection:** Automated static code quality analysis must run automatically on commits and pull requests.
2. **Detection Scope:**
   - Identification of bugs, logic flaws, and dead code.
   - Code smells, complexity thresholds, and maintainability issues.
   - Code duplication and styling conformance.
   - TypeScript / JavaScript type checking and strict linting.
3. **Quality Gate:** Code that fails static analysis quality gates or introduces critical code smells must be remediated prior to merge.

---

## Rule 3: Pre-Build & Pre-Deploy SAST (Static Application Security Testing via CodeMender)
1. **Mandatory SAST & Vulnerability Lifecycle:** Static Application Security Testing and vulnerability remediation must be executed prior to build and deployment using the **CodeMender skill** (`_agents/skills/codemender/SKILL.md`).
2. **Tooling & CodeMender (`cm` CLI) Workflow:**
   - **Discovery (`cm find`):** Scan source files and configs for software weaknesses (`cm find <target_path> -y --bypass-warning`), generating `docs/codemender-01-vulnerability-scan-report.md`.
   - **Verification & Triage (`cm verify`):** Synthesize and run isolated PoC exploits in local sandboxes to eliminate false positives (`cm verify <finding_id> -y --bypass-warning`), generating `docs/codemender-02-verification-report.md`.
   - **Automated Remediation (`cm fix`):** Refactor vulnerable code constructs and validate regression test suites (`cm fix <finding_id> -y --bypass-warning`), generating `docs/codemender-03-remediation-report.md`.
3. **Zero High/Critical Vulnerabilities:** Builds and deployments must fail if unaddressed High or Critical security vulnerabilities are detected in application code. Master security summary reports must be published to `docs/codemender-security-audit-summary.md`.

---

## Rule 4: Artifact Analysis & Open-Source Dependency Security
1. **Automated Vulnerability & License Compliance:** Use **Google Cloud Artifact Analysis** (Container Analysis) to scan all container images stored in Artifact Registry.
2. **Dependency Risk Management:**
   - Automatically analyze open-source packages (npm packages, Python libraries, OS base packages) for known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).
   - Verify license compliance across all third-party dependencies to eliminate restrictive or incompatible licenses.
3. **Continuous Monitoring:** Container images in Artifact Registry must be continuously scanned for newly published vulnerabilities.

---

## Rule 5: Multi-Environment Cloud Build Automation & Artifact Registry Storage
1. **Branch-Aware Automated Builds:** Use **Google Cloud Build** (`cloudbuild.yaml`) as the automated build, test, and deployment engine mapped to the active branch:
   - Commits to the **Non-Prod branch** trigger automated builds and deployment targeting the **Non-Prod environment**.
   - Merges/tags on the **Prod branch** trigger production verification and deployment targeting the **Production environment**.
2. **Artifact Registry Repository & Environment Tagging:**
   - Container images and deployment packages are stored in **Google Cloud Artifact Registry**.
   - Container image tags must include immutable identifiers with environment tagging (e.g., `${_ENVIRONMENT}-${SHORT_SHA}`, semantic release tags).
3. **Isolated & Reproducible Builds:** Builds must execute within containerized Cloud Build steps without host-specific assumptions.

---

## Rule 6: Cloud Run Observability (Web Applications, API Proxies, Liveness Probes, Logging & Monitoring)
1. **Target Workloads on Cloud Run:**
   - **Google Cloud Run** is the dedicated runtime for web frontend applications (React/Vite), API gateways, and thin streaming reverse proxies. Conversational AI agent reasoning engines are decoupled and hosted on the **Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform (`agent_runtime`)** (`_agents/rules/google_adk_and_agent_runtime.md`).
2. **Liveness & Health Probes:**
   - Applications running on Cloud Run must expose a dedicated health endpoint (`/healthz` or `/api/health`).
   - Cloud Run service configuration must declare a **Liveness Probe** (and Startup Probe if required) pointing to this endpoint to detect unresponsiveness and auto-restart failed containers.
3. **Cloud Logging:**
   - Application logs must output structured JSON or standard log streams to stdout/stderr.
   - Cloud Logging must capture all request logs, AI model proxy latencies, and error stack traces.
4. **Cloud Monitoring:**
   - Configure Cloud Monitoring dashboards and alert policies for container health, CPU/memory utilization, request latency (p95/p99), 5xx error rates, and Gemini API quota consumption.

---

## Rule 7: Post-Deployment Integration & Smoke Testing
1. **Automated Post-Deploy Verification:** Immediately after deploying a new revision to Cloud Run, an automated integration/smoke test step must execute against the deployed service URL.
2. **Verification Scope:**
   - Liveness probe verification (`GET /healthz`).
   - Core API functionality verification (e.g. backend proxy connectivity, authentication handshake).
   - End-to-end sanity check ensuring the deployed revision is fully operational.
3. **Automated Rollback on Failure:** If post-deployment integration tests fail, deployment notifications must alert the team, and traffic shifting/rollback must be triggered.

---

## Rule 8: Centralized Multi-Environment `.env` Parameter Management (Unified Single File)
1. **Zero Hardcoding:** No configurable parameters may be hardcoded in application source code, Dockerfiles, or client-side scripts.
2. **Unified Multi-Environment Configuration File:**
   - Parameters for **both Non-Prod and Prod environments** must be maintained in the **same unified `.env` file** (with a documented template in `.env.example`).
   - The `.env` file structure organizes variables into:
     - **Shared / Core Section:** Base settings common to all environments (e.g., `GCP_PROJECT`, `GCP_REGION`, `GENAI_LOCATION`, `DEFAULT_MODEL`, `ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPO`, `GITHUB_REPO`).
     - **Non-Prod Configuration Block (`NONPROD_*`):** Non-prod specific values (e.g., `NONPROD_ENVIRONMENT_NAME=development`, `NONPROD_FRONTEND_SERVICE_NAME`, `NONPROD_BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME`, `NONPROD_DEPLOYMENT_ID`, `NONPROD_MIN_INSTANCES=0`, `NONPROD_MAX_INSTANCES=5`, service accounts).
     - **Prod Configuration Block (`PROD_*`):** Prod specific values (e.g., `PROD_ENVIRONMENT_NAME=production`, `PROD_FRONTEND_SERVICE_NAME`, `PROD_BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME`, `PROD_DEPLOYMENT_ID`, `PROD_MIN_INSTANCES=1`, `PROD_MAX_INSTANCES=10`, service accounts).
   - CI/CD pipelines, build scripts, and local runners resolve the appropriate configuration block dynamically based on the active Git branch or target environment selection.
3. **Secret Isolation:**
   - Sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys, service account keys) must NEVER be committed to GitHub.
   - Local development uses `.env` (ignored by `.gitignore`).
   - Cloud environments supply configuration via Cloud Build substitutions, Cloud Run environment variables, or Google Cloud Secret Manager.

---

## Rule 9: Multi-Environment IaC & Deployment via Terraform & Google Cloud Infrastructure Manager
1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
   - Cloud infrastructure resources (Cloud Run services, Artifact Registry repositories, IAM roles, service accounts, monitoring alerts) are declaratively codified in **Terraform** (`terraform/` directory), parameterized to support multiple environment deployments from a single codebase.
2. **Independent Infrastructure Manager Deployments:**
   - Non-Prod and Prod environments are provisioned as independent **Google Cloud Infrastructure Manager** deployments (e.g., `<service>-nonprod` vs `<service>-prod`, or `app-nonprod` vs `app-prod`), ensuring complete isolation of Terraform state, service lifecycle, and scaling profiles.
3. **Reproducible & Tracked Deployments:**
   - Infrastructure Manager deployment revisions must be tied to specific Git commits/SHAs, branch names, and Cloud Build runs.
   - Drift detection and automated rollbacks must be supported through Infrastructure Manager deployment manifests.

---

## Rule 10: IAM Domain Restricted Sharing & Authentication Architecture Standards
1. **Organization Policy Constraint (Domain Restricted Sharing):**
   - The GCP organization enforces `constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains`, which strictly forbids adding `allUsers`, `allAuthenticatedUsers`, or identities outside the permitted customer domains to IAM policies.
   - Agents and developers **MUST NEVER** attempt to write `allUsers` or `allAuthenticatedUsers` to Terraform `google_cloud_run_v2_service_iam_member` resources or GCP IAM policy bindings.
2. **Mandatory Authentication & Ingress Recommendations:**
   When designing, configuring, or reviewing authentication and ingress for applications, the agent must recommend the appropriate compliant architectural pattern:
   - **Pattern 1: Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) (Recommended for Production-Grade Enterprise External Apps):**
     - Deploy Cloud Run behind an External HTTPS Application Load Balancer with Serverless Network Endpoint Group (Serverless NEG).
     - Restrict Cloud Run ingress to `INGRESS_TRAFFIC_INTERNAL_LOAD_BALANCER`.
     - Enforce Google OAuth 2.0 and central IAM / Google Workspace group authorization at the IAP gateway edge. Zero `allUsers` IAM binding required.
   - **Pattern 2: App-Level Google OAuth 2.0 (Recommended for Internal Apps / PoCs requiring Google User Context):**
     - Deploy Cloud Run with direct ingress and annotation `run.googleapis.com/invoker-iam-disabled = "true"` (empty IAM policy, zero Org Policy violations).
     - Embed Google Identity Services (Sign in with Google) / OAuth 2.0 Client ID in the web frontend, and verify user ID tokens inside the backend application code.
   - **Pattern 3: Direct Unauthenticated Ingress (Recommended for Public / Friction-Free Internal Web Tools):**
     - Deploy Cloud Run frontend service with `annotations = { "run.googleapis.com/invoker-iam-disabled" = "true" }` and `ingress = "INGRESS_TRAFFIC_ALL"`.
     - Zero IAM policy member bindings on the public frontend service (100% Org Policy compliant).
     - Backend API services remain strictly private (`roles/run.invoker` granted exclusively to the frontend Service Account).
