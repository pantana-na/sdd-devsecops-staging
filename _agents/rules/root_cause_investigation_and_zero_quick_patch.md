# Rule: Mandatory Root Cause Investigation & Zero Quick-Patch Standard

## Core Mandate
When any test fails (**Agent Evaluation (`agents-cli eval`)**, **Property-Based Tests (PBT)**, **Unit Tests**, or **Integration Tests**), or when a user reports a defect or requests a bug fix:

**DEVELOPERS AND AI AGENTS ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED FROM APPLYING QUICK FIXES, MOCKUP FALLBACK DATA, REGEX PATCHES, OR RULE-BASED CODE WORKAROUNDS.**

Under all circumstances, the developer/agent must:
1. **Investigate the actual root cause** across the live data, model reasoning, tool contracts, or system architecture.
2. **Transparently explain to the user** why the failure occurred, backed by technical evidence.
3. **Present viable architectural fix choices** along with their trade-offs.
4. **Await explicit user instruction** on which fix approach to implement before writing any modification.

## 1. Scope of Enforcement
This rule applies across the entire software lifecycle:
- **Agent Evaluations (`agents-cli eval run`):** Trajectory deviations, tool selection errors, hallucination, or safety guardrail failures.
- **Property-Based Testing (PBT / Hypothesis / Fast-Check):** Invariant violations, shrinking counterexamples, or boundary crashes.
- **Deterministic Unit Testing:** Assertion mismatches, contract breaks, or unhandled exceptions.
- **Integration & Deployment Testing:** Health/liveness probe timeouts, API status errors, or database synchronization failures.
- **User Bug Reports & Fix Requests:** Any user prompt stating "Fix X", "Why did Y happen?", or requesting behavioral corrections.

---

## 2. Strictly Prohibited Anti-Patterns (The "Quick-Fix" Trap)

The following practices are **strictly prohibited** in this repository:

1. ❌ **Mockup Data & Fallback Dictionaries:**
   - Injecting synthetic fallback dictionaries or offline mockup data into application code to bypass missing or inconsistent database records.
   - *Example Prohibited:* `if not db_result: return {"id": "ITEM-123", "status": "ACTIVE"}`.

2. ❌ **Rule-Based Quick Patching & Special-Casing:**
   - Writing prompt-specific `if/else` checks or hardcoding special-case answers for specific test prompts.
   - *Example Prohibited:* `if "specific_query" in prompt: return 42`.

3. ❌ **Regex & Keyword Heuristics in Agents:**
   - Adding regex matching or substring heuristics to patch agent classification or routing errors (violating [`google_adk_and_agent_runtime.md`](./google_adk_and_agent_runtime.md)).

4. ❌ **Assertion Weakening / Test Deletion:**
   - Modifying test assertions, deleting failing test cases, or widening tolerances simply to make a red test turn green without solving the underlying defect.

5. ❌ **Hardcoding Domain Constants in Code:**
   - Storing business rules, operational limits, category mappings, or entity definitions directly in application code constants instead of querying the appropriate systems of record (Databases, Knowledge Bases, Document Catalogs, or Cloud Storage).

## 3. Mandatory 4-Step Root Cause Investigation Protocol

When a test fails or a fix is requested, the developer/agent **MUST** execute the following protocol sequentially:

### Step 1: Deep Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
- Thoroughly inspect the failure trajectory:
  - Examine database state and backend records (Relational tables, Graph nodes/edges, Document collections, or Knowledge Catalog entries).
  - Inspect Google ADK tool docstrings, parameter types, and negative constraints.
  - Review model cognitive prompts, reasoning context, and temperature settings.
  - Trace network logs, stack traces, and exact failing inputs.
- Isolate the true architectural or data root cause:
  - *Is data missing, incomplete, or corrupted in the database/knowledge base?*
  - *Is a tool docstring ambiguous, causing the model to misselect or skip it?*
  - *Are prompt instructions conflicting or lacking explicit negative constraints?*
  - *Is there a contract or schema mismatch between frontend and backend?*

### Step 2: Transparent Failure Explanation to User
Present a structured, factual diagnostic report to the user detailing:
- **The Exact Failure:** The failing prompt, test name, input arguments, and expected vs actual result.
- **Technical Root Cause:** Clear explanation of the mechanics that caused the failure (e.g. why the model chose Tool B instead of Tool A, or why the database query returned 0 rows).
- **Supporting Evidence:** Relevant log excerpts, database query results, or tool response payloads.

### Step 3: Present Architectural Fix Options & Trade-Offs
Formulate at least **two (2) viable, sustainable engineering options** that resolve the root cause without shortcuts:
- **Option A (e.g., Data Tier Resolution):** Populate or correct records in the database / knowledge base to ground the agent on accurate truth.
- **Option B (e.g., Cognitive Tool Prompt Refinement):** Clarify tool docstrings with explicit "When to use" vs "When NOT to use" negative rules and update orchestrator instructions.
- **Option C (e.g., Schema & Validation Hardening):** Adjust Pydantic / TypeScript validation schemas or database constraints to enforce invariants.
- **Provide Trade-Offs:** Outline the pros, cons, blast radius, and migration effort for each option.

### Step 4: Await Explicit User Instruction Before Coding
- **NEVER unilaterally jump into writing code or applying patches.**
- Present the options clearly to the user:
  > *"We have investigated the root cause of this failure. Here are the viable approaches to resolve it cleanly. How would you like us to proceed?"*
- Wait for the user to select or instruct the desired resolution path before implementing any change.

## 4. Enforcement & Quality Gates

1. **Pre-Commit Verification:** Every change must prove that fixes were applied to the root cause (data, prompt design, schema, or system contract) rather than local heuristic patches.
2. **Zero-Mock Policy:** Code reviews must verify that no synthetic stubs or fallback dictionaries were introduced into production paths.
3. **Spec Synchronization:** Any structural change must be documented in the corresponding SDD in `specs/features/` and recorded in `specs/plan/`.
